# local

The `local` metrics plugin stores the values on memory.

## Parameters

### `default_labels`

Specifies the default labels for the metrics. \(default: `{agent: "Fluentd", hostname: "#{Socket.gethostname}"}`\)

### `labels`

Specifies other custom labels for the metrics. \(default: `{}`\)

## Example

With this configuration:

```text
<system>
  <metrics>
    @type local
  </metrics>
</system>
```

The above configuration will save the internal metrics for plugins on memory. As a result, you can retrieve metrics from memory and also you can replace with your custom metrics plugin.

Actually, @type local metrics plugin has equivalent functionality for previous single value based Ruby instance variables.
This behavior will be changed by other 3rd party plugins.
