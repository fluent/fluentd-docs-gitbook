# Installing Fluentd Using deb Package

This article explains how to install the
[td-agent](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/td-agent) deb package,
the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).


## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive
parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing
and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is
providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The
differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found
[here](//www.fluentd.org/faqs).

This installation guide is for td-agent v3, the new stable version.
td-agent v3 uses fluentd v1.0 in the core. See [this page](/overview/td-agent-v2-vs-v3.md) for the comparison between v2 and v3.


## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md) to configure
your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.


## Step 1: Install from Apt Repository

For Ubuntu, we currently support "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / Bionic 64bit",
"Ubuntu 16.04 LTS / Xenial 64bit", "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / Trusty 64bit".
For Debian, we currently support "Debian 9 Stretch 64bit", "Debian 8
Jessie 64bit".

A shell script is provided to automate the installation process for each
version. The shell script registers a new apt repository at
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent`
deb package.

For Ubuntu Bionic,

```
curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-bionic-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

For Ubuntu Xenial,

```
curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-xenial-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

For Ubuntu Trusty,

```
curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

For Debian Stretch,

```
curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-stretch-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

For Debian Jessie,

```
curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-jessie-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up **ntpd** on the node to prevent
invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md).


## Step 2: Launch Daemon


### systemd

The `/lib/systemd/system/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or
restart the agent.

```
$ sudo systemctl start td-agent.service
$ sudo systemctl status td-agent.service
● td-agent.service - td-agent: Fluentd based data collector for Treasure Data
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/td-agent.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2017-12-07 15:12:27 PST; 6min ago

Dec 07 15:12:27 ubuntu systemd[1]: Started td-agent: Fluentd based data collector for Treasure Data.
```

If you want to customize systemd behaviour, put your `td-agent.service`
into `/etc/systemd/system`


### init.d

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart
the agent.

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
td-agent (pid  21678) is running...
```

The following commands are supported:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
```

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at
`/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.


## Step 3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs
from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`).
You can post sample log records using the curl command.

```
$ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
```
