# Installing Fluentd Using rpm Package

This article explains how to install the
[td-agent](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/td-agent) rpm package,
the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).


## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive
parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing
and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is
providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The
differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found
[here](//www.fluentd.org/faqs).

This installation guide is for td-agent v3, the new stable version.
td-agent v3 uses fluentd v1.0 in the core. See [this page](/overview/td-agent-v2-vs-v3.md) for the comparison between v2 and v3.


## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md) to configure
your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.


## Step 1: Install from rpm Repository

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up **ntpd** on the node to prevent
invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md).


### Redhat / CentOS

CentOS and RHEL 6, 7 64bit are currently supported.

Executing
[install-redhat-td-agent3.sh](https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent3.sh)
will automatically install td-agent on your machine. This shell script
registers a new rpm repository at `/etc/yum.repos.d/td.repo` and
installs the `td-agent` rpm package.

```
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

We use \$releasever for repository path in the script and \$releasever
should be only major version like \"7\". If your environment uses other
format like \"7.2\", change it to only major version or setup TD
repository manually.


### Amazon Linux

Mainly for Amazon Linux 2. Recent two 64bit versions are supported for
amazon linux 1. This means if latest version is `2018.03`, rpm is
provided for `2018.03` and `2017.09`.

```
# Amazon Linux 2
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon2-td-agent3.sh | sh
# Amazon Linux 1
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon1-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

Newer td-agent 3 no longer support Amazon Linux 1. If you want to use
latest td-agent 3, please upgrade your Amazon Linux 1 to Amazon Linux 2.

We use \$releasever for repository path in the script and \$releasever
should be \"year.month\" format like \"2017.09\". On AWS, some services
modify \$releasever to own format and it will cause installation
failure. If your environment's \$releasever is non-\"year.month\"
format, change it to \"year.month\" format or setup TD repository
manually.


## Step 2: Launch Daemon

td-agent provides 2 scripts:


### systemd

The `/usr/lib/systemd/system/td-agent` script is provided to start,
stop, or restart the agent.

```
$ sudo systemctl start td-agent.service
$ sudo systemctl status td-agent.service
● td-agent.service - td-agent: Fluentd based data collector for Treasure Data

```

If you want to customize systemd behaviour, put your `td-agent.service`
into `/etc/systemd/system`


### init.d

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart
the agent.

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
Starting td-agent: [  OK  ]
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
td-agent (pid  21678) is running...
```

The following commands are supported:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
```

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at
`/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.


## Step 3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs
from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`).
You can post sample log records using the curl command.

```
$ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
```
