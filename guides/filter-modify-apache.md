# Easy Data Stream Manipulation using Fluentd

Sometimes, you need to transform the data stream in a certain way. For
example, you might want to extract a potion of data for error reporting,
or need to append additional information to events for later inspection.

This article explains common data-manipulation techniques in details.


## How to Filter Events by Fields

[filter\_grep](/plugins/filter/grep.md) is a built-in plugin that allows to filter
the data stream using regular expressions.

Suppose you are managing a web service, and try to monitor the access
logs using Fluentd. In this case, an event in the data stream will look
like:

```
{
  "host": "192.168.1.1",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/index.html",
  "code": 200,
  "size": 2344,
  "referer": null
}
```

Let's filter out all the successful responses with 2xx status codes, so
that we can easily inspect if any error has occurred in the service:

```
<filter apache.**>
  @type grep
  <exclude>
    key code
    pattern ^2\d\d$
  </exclude>
</filter>
```

You can also filter the data using multiple fields. For example, the
following example will keep all 5xx server errors, except those coming
from the test directory:

```
<filter apache.**>
  @type grep
  <regexp>
    key code
    pattern ^5\d\d$
  </regexp>
  <exclude>
    key path
    pattern ^/test/
  </exclude>
</filter>
```


## How to Inject Custom Fields into Events

[filter\_record\_transformer](/plugins/filter/record_transformer.md) is a built-in
plugin that enables to inject arbitrary data into events.

Suppose you are running a web service on multiple web servers, and you
want to record which server handled each request. This can be
implemented trivially using this plugin:

```
<filter apache.**>
  @type record_transformer
  <record>
    server "${hostname}"
  </record>
</filter>
```

This will produce an event like below:

```
{
  "host": "192.168.1.1",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/index.html",
  "code": 200,
  "size": 2344,
  "referer": null,
  "server": "app1"
}
```

Note that `${hostname}` is a pre-defined variable supplied by the
plugin. You can also define a custom variable, or even evaluate
arbitrary ruby expressions. For details, please read [the manual page of this plugin](/plugins/filter/record_transformer.md).
