# Cloud Data Logger by Raspberry Pi

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit-card-sized
single-board computer. Because it is low-cost and easy to equip with
various types of sensors, using Raspberry Pi as a cloud data logger is
one of its ideal use cases.

This article introduces how to transport sensor data from Raspberry Pi
to the cloud, using Fluentd as the data collector. For the cloud side,
we'll use the [Treasure Data](http://www.fluentd.org/treasuredata)
cloud data service as an example, but you can use any cloud service in
its place.


## Install Raspbian

[Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) is a free operating system based
on Debian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi. Please install Raspbian on
your Raspberry Pi by following the instructions in the blog post below:

- [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi: Installing Raspbian](http://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/getting-started-raspberry-pi-install-raspbian)


## Install Fluentd

Next, we'll install Fluentd on Raspbian. Raspbian Stretch with desktop
and recommended software bundles Ruby 2.3.3 by default, but we need
the extra development package to install Fluentd.

    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-dev

We'll now install Fluentd and the necessary plugins.

    $ sudo gem install fluentd
    $ sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-td


## Configure and Launch Fluentd

Please sign up to Treasure Data from the
[sign up page](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/sign_up).
Its free plan lets you store and analyze millions of data points.
You can get your account's API key from the [users page](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current).

Please prepare the `fluentd.conf` file with the following information,
including your API key.

    <match td.*.*>
      @type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

      auto_create_table
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /home/pi/fluentd/td
      </buffer>
    </match>
    <source>
      @type http
      port 8888
    </source>
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>

Finally, please launch Fluentd via your terminal.

    $ fluentd -c fluent.conf


## Upload Test

To test the configuration, just post a JSON message to Fluentd via
HTTP.

    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"sensor1":3123.13,"sensor2":321.3}' \
      http://localhost:8888/td.testdb.raspberrypi

NOTE: If you're using Python, you can use Fluentd's
[python logger](/language/python) library.

Now, access the databases page to confirm that your data has been
uploaded to the cloud properly.

* [Treasure Data: List of Databases](https://console.treasuredata.com/databases)

You can now issue queries against the imported data.

* [Treasure Data: New Query](https://console.treasuredata.com/query_forms/new)

For example, these queries calculate the average sensor1 value and
the sum of sensor2 values.

    SELECT AVG(sensor1) FROM raspberrypi;
    SELECT SUM(sensor2) FROM raspberrypi;


## Conclusion

Raspberry Pi is an ideal platform for prototyping data logger hardware.
Fluentd helps Raspberry Pi transfer the collected data to the cloud
easily and reliably.
